# Cybersecurity-Portfolio

Hi, I'm Carmelo Rosario III 👋
Aspiring SOC Analyst | Cybersecurity Researcher

I am a highly disciplined professional transitioning from a career in high-stakes logistics to Cybersecurity Operations. I specialize in building isolated lab environments to simulate real-world threats and defensive monitoring.

I don't just use tools; I document the why behind the security risks and the how of the remediation.
🛡️ Technical Security Portfolio

Below are five verified lab environments demonstrating my proficiency in the core pillars of security operations.
Project	Focus Area	Key Tools
Project 1: Lab Architecture	Network Isolation & Virtualization	VirtualBox, NAT Networking
Project 2: Traffic Analysis	Packet Inspection & Protocol Risks	Wireshark, TCPDump
Project 3: Vulnerability Mgmt	Risk Assessment & CVE Mapping	Nmap (NSE), NVD Database
Project 4: SIEM Operations	Threat Detection & Log Analysis	Splunk Enterprise, SPL
Project 5: Social Engineering	Human Risk & MFA Implementation	SET, Phishing Simulation
🛠️ Core Competencies

    Security Monitoring: Analyzing logs in Splunk to identify brute-force and privilege escalation patterns.

    Network Defense: Understanding of the OSI model, port forwarding, and securing unencrypted protocols.

    Technical Reporting: Translating complex scan data into executive-level remediation plans.

    Independent Problem Solving: Proven ability to troubleshoot environment configuration and tool dependencies autonomously.
