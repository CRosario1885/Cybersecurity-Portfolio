# [Project Name: Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Remediation]

## 📝 Executive Summary
**Objective:** To identify , verify, and categorize security weaknesses within a target infrastructure using industry-standard scanning tools.
**Outcome:** Conducted an automated vulnerability scan that identified a Critical (10.0 CVSS) backdoor in the vsftpd service. Authored a remediation plan to secure the asset.

## 🛠️ Environment & Tools
* **Scanner:** Kali Linux (IP: 10.0.2.4)
* **Target:** Metasploitable 2 (IP: 10.0.2.5)
* **Tools:** Nmap (Scripting Engine), CVE Details Database
* **Network:** Isolated VirtualBox Nat Network

## 🏗️ Lab Topology

The scanner probes the target ports to identify running services and compares them against a database of known vulnerabilities (CVEs).

## 🛡️ Step-by-Step Methodology
1. **Service Discovery:** Performed an initial scan to find open ports and service versions: nmap -sV 10.0.2.5.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Executed the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) specifically for vulnerabilities: nmap -sV --script vuln 10.0.2.5.
3. **Finding Analysis:** Identified a specific vulnerability in the FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4).
4. **CVE Mapping:** Cross-referenced teh scan results with the National Vulnerabillity Database (NVD) to determine the severity and impact.

## 📊 Findings & Evidence
**Service:** vsFTPd version 2.3.4
**Vulnerability:** Backdoor Command Execution
**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-2523
**CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Critical)
**Impact:** Full System Takeover

**Observation:** The scan revealed that the FTP service on port 21 is running a version known to contain a malicious backdoor. This allows an unauthenticated user to gain a "root"shell by providing a specific string in the username.

## 💡 Remediation & Analysis
**The Problem:** Running "End-of-Life" (EOL) or intentionally backdoored sofware creates an immediate entry point for attackers. A CVSS 10.0 indicates that no special privileges are required and the attack is easy to execute.
**The Solution:**
1. Immediate Fix: Stop and disable the vsftpd service: sudo service vsftpd stop.
2. Patch Management: Update the FTP server to a secure version (e.g., vsftpd 3.x) or replace with ProFTPD configured for security.
3. Network Hardening: Implement a firewall (iptables or ufw) to restrict port 21 access to only authorized IP addresses.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This lab demonstrated the power of automated scanning in identifying "low-hanging fruti" vulnerabilities. It emphasized the importance of maintaining an accurate asset inventory and the critical need for regular patch management to defend against known exploits.
